Changes some of the deepslate ore textures into custom ones I made meant to look like the old ore textures while keeping the look of the deepslate ores. I made the specular and normal maps by mashing together the deepslate maps with the regular ore maps from older VNR versions. It also replaces most of the normal ores with the old VNR versions.",
