I think I have half/two-thirds-ish of the blocks done. Pretty much all of the work left at this point is just renaming files, unfortunately there are a lot of them.

Ignore the fact that the title screen panorama is pictures of amogus, that is a placeholder. I'll make an actual one when I fix enough of the blocks.
