I think I have half/two-thirds-ish of the blocks done. Pretty much all of the work left at this point is just renaming files, unfortunately there are a lot of them.

Ignore the fact that the title screen panorama is pictures of amogus, that is a placeholder. I'll make an actual one when I fix enough of the blocks.

The deepslate textures are actually my own that I made to look like the older ore textures and I mashed together some of the VNR specular and normal maps to. They're there because they were in the Vanilla Normals Renewed folder that I converted. Those won't be in the final version but ill add them in a separate folder if anyone likes how they look.

The official repository is missing a ton of normals and speculars cause the creators doing a "big clean" or something. I fished out the latest versions of those textures out of Poudingue's commit history to use on my personal Vanilla Normals Renewed folder, meaning that this version is not missing those normals and speculars either as they got ported too.
